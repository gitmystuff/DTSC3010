        "\n",
        "* **Interpreted**: a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. (Compiled languages: Go, C++)\n",
        "* **Object Oriented**: a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A common feature of objects is that procedures are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields.\n",
        "* **Object**: An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data. Similarly, a class is a blueprint for that object. We can think of a class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc.\n",
        "* **High-Level Language**: A high-level language (HLL) is a programming language such as C, FORTRAN, or Pascal that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular type of computer. Such languages are considered high-level because they are closer to human languages and further from machine languages. Python, C#, C++, PHP, Java vs assembly language and machine code\n",
        "* **Dynamic Semantics**: dynamic objects are instances of values contained into constructs in the code, and they exist at run-time level. Furthermore, we can assign to one object multiple values, since it will update itself, differently from a static semantic language. Namely, if we set a=2 and then a=’hello’, the string value will substitute the integer one as soon as the line is executed\n",
        "* **Built-In Data Structures**: Organizing, managing, and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications. Data Structures allows you to organize your data in such a way that enables you to store collections of data, relate them and perform operations on them accordingly. Python has implicit support for Data Structures which enable you to store and access data. Some of these structures are called List, Dictionary, Tuple and Set.\n",
        "* **Dynamic Typing**: The term dynamic typing means that a compiler or an interpreter assigns a type to all the variables at run-time. The type of a variable is decided based on its value. The programs written using dynamic-typed languages are more flexible but will compile even if they contain errors.\n"

        "Performance Trade-Off\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Static Typing**: Because types are checked at compile time, the program knows exactly what kind of data is in each variable before it runs. This allows the compiler to create highly optimized machine code that can execute very efficiently. There is no need for extra checks during runtime, which saves processing time.\n",
        "* **Dynamic Typing**: With dynamic typing, the program must perform type checks on the fly, as the code is being executed. This adds a small overhead to every operation, as the program has to determine the type of the variable at that exact moment. This continuous process of checking types at runtime makes dynamically typed languages inherently slower than their statically typed counterparts.\n",
        "\n",
        "While this performance difference exists, it's often not a major issue for most applications. The speed and flexibility of dynamic languages like Python make them ideal for many tasks, such as scripting, web development, and data analysis, where development speed is more important than raw execution speed. For applications where performance is critical (like system software, game engines, or high-frequency trading), a statically typed language is usually the better choice."

        "* **The Problem:** Because the input (`0.1666...`) was already an imperfect approximation, the `Fraction` class tried to be **too literal**. It created a massive, ugly fraction that mathematically equals that exact messy decimal you gave it.\n",

        "\n",
        "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was perhaps the ultimate polymath—a mathematician, diplomat, and philosopher who sought to synthesize all human knowledge into a single, logical system.\n",
        "\n",
        "His contributions to the topics you mentioned often stem from a core desire for harmony and the **Principle of Sufficient Reason**: the idea that nothing happens without a reason why it should be so rather than otherwise.\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Bias and Beliefs\n",
        "\n",
        "In his *New Essays on Human Understanding*, Leibniz addressed how humans form beliefs and the \"pre-judices\" that lead to error.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Innate Ideas:** Unlike Locke (who argued for a *tabula rasa*), Leibniz believed the mind is like a \"veined block of marble.\" The veins represent innate tendencies or \"dispositions\" of thought.\n",
        "* **Petites Perceptions:** He theorized that we have many unconscious \"minute perceptions\" (unconscious biases) that influence our conscious beliefs.\n",
        "* **The Solution:** He hoped to eliminate human bias through his **Characteristica Universalis**—a universal symbolic language. He famously said that if two people disagreed, they should simply sit down with their pens and say, *\"Calculemus\"* (Let us calculate), to find the objective truth.\n",

        "## Determinism vs. Probability\n",
        "\n",
        "Leibniz was a pioneer in both the metaphysics of necessity and the mathematics of chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Determinism:** Leibniz held a view called **Predicate-in-Notion**. This means that the concept of an individual (like \"Cliff\") contains everything that will ever happen to them. From God's perspective, the future is \"encoded\" in the present.\n",
        "* **Probability:** Despite this \"hard\" logical determinism, Leibniz was one of the first to treat **probability** as a formal logic for uncertain situations. He applied this to law and insurance, arguing that since humans lack \"infinite analysis\" (we can't see the full code), we must use probability to quantify our ignorance.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **The Monad as an Object:** Leibniz's \"Monads\" are the building blocks of reality. They are like software objects:\n",
        "* **Encapsulation:** He said Monads \"have no windows.\" They do not interact with each other; their \"state\" is entirely internal.\n",
        "* **State and Logic:** Every Monad has *perception* (current state) and *appetition* (the internal logic/drive to move to the next state).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Classes:** In his work on logical calculus, he treated properties as sets. He worked on a \"calculus of identities\" where complex concepts (the Class) are built from the intersection of simpler \"primitive\" attributes.\n",

        "Instead, he proposed **Pre-established Harmony**. Imagine two clocks that keep perfect time. They aren't connected, but when one strikes twelve, the other does too because they were both synchronized by a master clockmaker at the start.\n",

        "* **The Mind** follows its own laws of final causes (desires/logic).\n",

        "* **Active vs. Passive Force:** * **Form** = *Primitive Active Force* (the \"spark\" or internal energy).\n",

        "* **Leibniz’s Differentials:** Leibniz arrived through logic and geometry. He focused on the sum of infinitesimal differences.\n",
        "* **The Winner (Notationally):** We use Leibniz's notation today because it is far more flexible. He gave us the \"integral\" symbol  (a stylized 'S' for *summa*) and the \"d\" notation (like ), whereas Newton's \"dot notation\" () is mostly relegated to specific physics contexts.\n",

        "\n",
        "* **Newton (Absolutism):** Viewed space and time as absolute \"containers\" created by God. Even if you removed all matter, space and time would still exist as an empty stage.\n",
        "* **Leibniz (Relationalism):** Argued that space and time are merely **relations** between objects.\n",
        "* **Space** is the \"order of co-existing things.\" Without objects, \"space\" is nothing.\n",
        "* **Time** is the \"order of successive things.\" Without events, \"time\" is nothing.\n",
        "* **The Argument:** Leibniz used the *Identity of Indiscernibles* to argue that if God moved the entire universe two feet to the left, and everything stayed the same relative to each other, there would be no reason for God to prefer one position over the other. Therefore, absolute space cannot exist because it would violate the Principle of Sufficient Reason."
